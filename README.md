# Visit Santorini Greece

 

### About the project:


Santorini Resorts Map is my last Udacity nano-degree project. In this project I show the user some of most beautiful places to visit in Santorini in Greece. This project was built with React, Google Maps API and FourSquare API.

 

\### How to run the project

 

\- download my repo from

 

 https://github.com/Dalia-Yahia/Santorini-Resorts-Map


\- run the following in your node.js after getting into the project folder

 `npm install`

  `npm install --save react-google-maps`

  `npm install -s superagent`

 `npm install --save escape-string-regexp sort-by`

  `npm start`


\### How to use this application
